### Abstract
As we come out of the pandemic, studies in the classroom are almost a bygone methodology, and the introduction of online lectures and classes have seen newer and newer ways of studying, and newer ideas to boost efficiency and productivity. Binging lectures like never before, and newer techniques of retaining and understanding information continue to evolve on a daily basis. Through this project, we aim to derive conclusions on various study environment related habits and choices that exist among students at IIT Hyderabad.

Initially, we collect the data using the survey and pre-process the data for getting all the important aspects we are working with. <br>
Next up, we visualized the data using various programming tools such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and finally analyzing the data. <br>
Conclusions were drawn after the data was visualized and analyzed properly. <br>


My Contributions to the Project:
- Ideation for the Project
- Analyzing the Uni-Variate Numerical Dataset and drawing conclusions
- Visualizing few of the categorical datasets with segmented bar charts
- Assisted in hypothesis testing
- Making presentation slides in beamer using LaTeX
